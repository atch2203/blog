Sometime during the middle of last week I decided to actually start playing CTFs, and I remember dungwinix mentioned that jellyc.tf was going on for 2 weeks and that it was good for beginners (aka me). 

> go check his writeups at https://dungwinux.github.io/-blog/security/2024/06/24/jellyctf.html, he actually was the first solo team to full clear w/o hints


TOC:
- <a href="#web">web</a>

I used a lot of hints (almost all of them), but I was able to solve 10/10 web, 6/8 osint, 3/3 pwn, 8/10 crypto, 6/7 forensics, 5/5 misc, 3/3 rev.

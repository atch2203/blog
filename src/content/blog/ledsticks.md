### Now onto how I got there
I think that most people can agree that everything looks better if you add LEDs to it, and diabolo is no exception.

However, I have an issue: Sundia's LED stick attachments are way to easy to break (especially if you hit the ground with them)

Since I wanted to do integrals with them (since I'm not good at vertax), I took it upon myself to make my own.

And thus began the quest for the unbreakable LED sticks...

## Threads and LEDs
In an effort to reduce my own work as much as possible, I attempted to copy and reuse as many parts of Sundia's LED attachment as much as possible. Unfortunately, the board with the LEDs on it was firmly epoxied in place, so I could only reuse the end cap.

By the end of all of my test prints, I had a working prototype of something that could 1) emit light and 2) be attached to the end of an LED stick. All that remained was to convert it to clear filament and iron out the inner dimensions of the attachment.

## finished with the attachments
clear TPU

issue: it flies off and is too dim, we want brighter!


## Something about custom LED sticks
- first iteration didn't work (insert images, weight, etc)

- polycarb sections - initial, weight/resistance too high, then final

Last semester, I took an honors colloquium for CS 335: Inside the Box: How Computers Work. The main section of the class was all about the different levels of technology that goes into a computer, from how transistors work to logic gates to processor components and more. For the colloquium project, I teamed up with [Sagnik Pal](http://www-edlab.cs.umass.edu/~sagnikpal/) to build an 8 bit computer out of some (not so) basic chips.

For this tutorial, you will need one (1) 8 bit computer. (Unfortunately, I only remembered to take photos as I was disassembling it)
